(ns websocket.handshake
  "RFC 6455 §4 — the opening handshake, as data.

  The handshake is an HTTP/1.1 upgrade whose only computed field is
  `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`: base64(SHA-1(key + GUID)). This namespace builds
  and validates the header maps and computes that field.

  SHA-1 is injected, not implemented here. `kotoba-lang/hash` owns SHA-1 for
  this workspace and it is written in `.kotoba`, so a `.cljc` leaf cannot
  require it; and duplicating a hash function to avoid one seam is a worse
  trade than the seam. Both host runtimes already ship SHA-1:

    JVM   (fn [bs] (vec (.digest (java.security.MessageDigest/getInstance \"SHA-1\")
                                 (byte-array (map unchecked-byte bs)))))
    node  (fn [bs] (vec (.digest (.update (crypto/createHash \"sha1\")
                                          (js/Uint8Array.from (clj->js bs))))))

  Base64 *is* implemented here. It is 30 lines of table lookup with no
  security surface, and pulling a dependency for it would pin this leaf to
  a runtime — the same reasoning `org-ietf-blake2` gives for having no deps
  at all."
